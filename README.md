### Backlog

MVP &rightarrow; Show simple page with all status

- [x] Read all light values from ioBroker
- [x] create simple dynamic html table (angular / vmware clarity)
- [x] sent all infomration for the table via socket.io

## Sprint 2 - Documentation

>**Node**
After analyses a lot of WEB Frameworks for angular I decided not to use material but VMWare Clarity.
The documentation and samples are very good and it fits to my requirements

>**Node**
I decided to use Compodoc for documentation.
So all the documentation are now to be found on the following link:
[Github Pages](https://swissglider.github.io/ioBroker.homeOverview/).
